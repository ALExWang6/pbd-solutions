//I was right about what the slashes signify, and they are comments which explains what parts of the code does, while not affecting the code

public class comments{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        // A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
        // Anything after the // is ignored by Java.
 	
	System.out.println( "I could have code like this." ); // and the comment after is ignored.

        // You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
        // System.out.println("This won't run.");

        System.out.println( "This will run." );
    }
